# To-Do_App

I created a to-do list application that combines a simple front-end design with API integration. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application offers an intuitive interface where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task is displayed with clear "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for easy management.
The application's core functionality is driven by JavaScript, which handles CRUD operations through the Fetch API. By connecting to the JSONPlaceholder API's /todos endpoint, I simulated a backend server. Adding a task sends a POST request, while existing tasks are retrieved with a GET request when the page loads. Editing and deleting tasks are managed through PUT and DELETE requests.
This project enhanced my skills in front-end development and API integration, allowing me to build a fully functional web application that efficiently manages tasks without needing a dedicated backend.
